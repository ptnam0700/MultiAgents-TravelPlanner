# MultiAgents-with-CrewAI-TravelItineraryPlanner

Welcome to the **AI Travel Itinerary Planner**, a modular multi-agent system built with Streamlit, LangGraph, and CrewAI-inspired architecture. This application leverages multiple AI agents to generate personalized travel itineraries and provide additional travel-related insights based on user preferences. The system is designed for modularity, with agents split into individual scripts for maintainability and scalability.

- **Repository**: [https://github.com/vikrambhat2/MultiAgents-with-CrewAI-TravelItineraryPlanner](https://github.com/vikrambhat2/MultiAgents-with-CrewAI-TravelItineraryPlanner)


## Overview

The AI Travel Itinerary Planner uses a LangGraph workflow to manage a set of agents that collaboratively process user inputs (e.g., destination, month, duration) to produce a detailed itinerary, activity suggestions, weather forecasts, packing lists, food/culture recommendations, useful links, and a chat interface. The system integrates with Ollama (for the `llama3.2` model) and the Google Serper API for web searches.

## Features
- Generate a detailed travel itinerary with daily plans, dining options, and downtime.
- Suggest unique local activities based on the itinerary and preferences.
- Fetch the top 5 travel guide links for the destination and month.
- Provide weather forecasts, packing lists, and food/culture recommendations.
- Offer a conversational chat to answer itinerary-related questions.
- Export the itinerary as a PDF.

- **agents/**: Contains individual Python scripts for each agent, modularizing the logic.
- **utils.py**: Houses shared utility functions (e.g., PDF export).
- **travel_agent.py**: The main Streamlit application file that orchestrates the workflow and UI.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists project dependencies.
- **.env**: Stores environment variables (e.g., `SERPER_API_KEY`).

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher.
- Ollama installed and running locally with the `llama3.2` model (`ollama pull llama3.2`).
- A Google Serper API key.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vikrambhat2/MultiAgents-with-CrewAI-TravelItineraryPlanner.git

   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add your `SERPER_API_KEY`:
     ```
     SERPER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```
4. Start Ollama locally (if not already running):
   ```bash
   ollama serve
   ```

### Running the Application
