# MultiAgents-with-Langgraph-TravelItineraryPlanner

Welcome to the **AI Travel Itinerary Planner**, a modular multi-agent system built with Streamlit, LangGraph, and Ollama. This application leverages multiple AI agents to generate personalized travel itineraries and provide additional travel-related insights based on user preferences. The system is designed for modularity, with agents split into individual scripts for maintainability and scalability.

- **Repository**: [https://github.com/vikrambhat2/MultiAgents-with-Langgraph-TravelItineraryPlanner](https://github.com/vikrambhat2/MultiAgents-with-Langgraph-TravelItineraryPlanner)


## Overview

The AI Travel Itinerary Planner uses a LangGraph workflow to manage a set of agents that collaboratively process user inputs (e.g., destination, month, duration) to produce a detailed itinerary, activity suggestions, weather forecasts, packing lists, food/culture recommendations, useful links, and a chat interface. The system integrates with Ollama (for the `llama3.2` model) and the Google Serper API for web searches.

## Features
- Generate a detailed travel itinerary with daily plans, dining options, and downtime.
- Suggest unique local activities based on the itinerary and preferences.
- Fetch the top 5 travel guide links for the destination and month.
- Provide weather forecasts, packing lists, and food/culture recommendations.
- Offer a conversational chat to answer itinerary-related questions.
- Export the itinerary as a PDF.
