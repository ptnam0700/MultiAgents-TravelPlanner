Vietnam’s Hidden Gems: 12 Breathtaking Places off the Tourist Trail
 
Vietnam is my favourite place on earth, and that’s official! Although I have only travelled there once, I spent two of the best weeks of my life discovering its history, culture, food, and people.
 
As a first-time visitor to Vietnam, I planned an extensive two-week itinerary from the country’s north to its south. I chose the well-trodden tourist trail, travelling from Hanoi to Halong Bay, then on to Hue and Hoi An and finishing off at a beach resort in Da Nang.
 
My trip was marvellous, but it got me thinking: If I was so enamoured by the tourist route I had taken, what could I find if I stepped off the beaten track in Vietnam and headed into more remote and unknown territories?
 
Would I discover the “forgotten” Vietnam I had read about in guidebooks or stumble upon villages where I would be the observed rather than the observer?
 
With this in mind, I wanted to hear stories from fellow travellers who had found secret spots and non-touristy things to do in Vietnam and were happy to share them with my readers. I am sure you will agree that these twelve hidden gems must be included in your travel itinerary; I know a few will make it on mine!

Mai Chau

Mai Chau is one of Vietnam’s hidden gems in the north, about four hours from Hanoi. It’s a relatively unexplored place where genuine, off-the-beaten-path adventure can be found.
 
Mai Chau’s journey begins with a long, twisty bus ride along a steep cliff. Eventually, the route leads into a valley of rice paddies surrounded by green mountains. The trip is not for the faint of heart.
 
Mai Chau’s main attraction is the Chieu Cave, 1000 steps above the city. At the start of the hike, a local may or may not be there to charge an entrance fee.
 
One thousand steps may seem daunting, especially with Vietnam’s humidity, but the hike is well worth it. The views of the surrounding valley are incredible. The cave is secondary to the sights, but worth a peek!
 
Instead of a checklist of tourist activities, Mai Chau is more of a place to relax in a traditional homestay, and observe Vietnam’s nature while enjoying local food and hospitality. Scooters are available for rent and can be used to explore the surrounding rice paddies and mountains.
 
Mai Chau is also a perfect halfway point to visit the incredible Pu Luong Nature Reserve. It is only a few hours away by scooter but recommended only for experienced travellers and drivers.
 
Pu Luong

Pu Luong Nature Reserve is a great off-the-beaten-track destination for trekking, mountain biking and homestays. It is a less touristy alternative to popular 2-day stays in Sapa or Mai Chau. The reserve is in Northern Vietnam’s Thanh Hoa Province. It is four hours southwest of Hanoi or three hours west of Ninh Binh by road.
 
The reserve encompasses two mountain ridges. The central valley features incredible rice terraces and small villages. These belong to families from the Thai and H’Mong ethnic minority communities.
 
Because Pu Luong is more remote and challenging to reach, tourism has developed here slowly.
 
When walking between villages or taking a multi-day trek deeper into the forest, it’s not uncommon to have the trail all to yourself.
 
Several mountain streams and cascades are inside the reserve, including the impressive Thac Hieu waterfall. A highlight is trekking to the top of Mount Pu Luong for a view of the valley.
 
Walking around the valley, you can admire Pu Luong’s iconic waterwheels. They are beautiful pieces of bamboo machinery built to carry water from low-lying streams into the rice paddies.
 
The valley offers many accommodations, from humble homestays to boutique bungalows. Pu Luong Retreat is the most popular.
 
The easiest way to reach Pu Luong is to hire a car and driver, which can be arranged through Daytrip.com. Alternatively, a daily bus from Hanoi to Pu Luong takes just over six hours.
 
Cat Ba National Park

Located off the beaten track in Vietnam, Cat Ba National Park is recognised by Unesco as a World Biosphere Reserve. It is a national gem known for its wildlife and incredible natural beauty.
 
The national park on Cat Ba Island has the country’s most extensive mangrove system, lush jungles, and beautiful beaches. It is also home to the world’s most endangered species: the Vooc (white-faced monkey).
 
You can also find deer, squirrels, and monkey species in the jungle forests of Cat Ba National Park. In the surrounding waters, marine life is abundant.
 
One of the most popular activities at Cat Ba National Park is hiking up to the Ngu Lam Peak lookout. This viewpoint offers panoramic views of the park and its uniquely shaped mountains.
 
If you prefer to be by the water, you can lounge on Khu du lịch đảo Nam Cát public beach or go kayaking. Kayaking can be done on the open water or through the infamous mangroves.
 
There is a smattering of accommodation options all over the island, but the most popular place to stay is in Cat Ba Town. The main port is in Cat Ba Town, and plenty of hotels, tour operators and restaurants are nearby. A journey by bus from Hanoi will take around 4-5 hours.
