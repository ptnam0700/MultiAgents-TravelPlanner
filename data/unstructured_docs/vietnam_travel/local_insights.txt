According to Savill’s in the first half of 2020 hotel occupancy rates fell to 12% compared to 78% a year ago.  Vietnam domestic tourism will rebound, initially conservatively and constrained.  Much of the industry will need to better understand Vietnam travel habits and pivot to serve Vietnam domestic tourism. Trip design, priorities, destinations and the experiences sought vary significantly by segment.

Naturally what a 55 year seeks from her summer holiday is very different to what a 32-year-old newlywed couple seek.   Travel agencies build packages around the needs of different segments very successfully. Destinations and hotel resorts need to build a far more razor-like focus on which Vietnamese domestic tourist segment they wish to serve.  Defining which segment to target and how best to provide them with a delightful experience is critical for winning customers, as competition for the domestic traveller in Vietnam will only intensify.

Vietnam travel research
The survey was conducted via personal face to face interviews with 520 people in Hanoi and HCMC. Quotas were set to represent the population with Vietnamese aged 18 to 70 from economic classes ABCD (which represents the top 55% of household wealth, the minimum level being a household income of 10,000,000 (USD430) per month). The initial interviews were conducted long before COVID-19, follow up interviews were conducted in June 2020 to look at emerging changes in travel plans.

Vietnamese travel habits
Cimigo Vietnam travel research shows that 76% of Vietnamese had at least one leisure trip in a 12 month period, in which 9% travelled overseas. The most popular destinations being Thailand and Singapore. On average, each traveller took 2 trips a year. A personal budget of 10 million VND (approximately USD430) is spent on leisure trips over a 12 month period.

June is normally the peak month of travelling. Given HCMC has less seasonable weather, people spread their trips throughout the year more than people in Hanoi.  The average leisure travelling days in a year is just 8 days.  Overall this equates to 10 million VND on average over 2 trips, each trip lasting 4 days.

Travel destinations for Vietnam domestic tourists
Ba Ria – Vung Tau and Lam Dong (Da Lat city) are the most visited and also considered the best value by people in HCMC.

Quang Ninh (Ha Long bay, Bai Chay beach, Co To island) and Thanh Hoa (Sam Son beach) are the most visited by travellers from Hanoi. Danang is however considered as a place with the best value.

Travel booking services for Vietnam domestic tourists
Cimigo Vietnam travel research shows that 31% of travellers have used travel agency services. Vietravel is dominant with a 20% share of use. Saigontourist is stronger in HCMC and Hanoitourist is stronger in Hanoi.

Vietnamese online travel platformsCimigo Vietnam travel research shows that only 1 in 4 use online travel platforms. Younger Vietnamese travellers have a greater propensity to use these platforms,   Booking.com and Traveloka stand out for all functions. Mytour is known for reviews and Agoda is known for hotel bookings.

Vietnamese travel habits by life stage
The experiences sought, the Vietnam domestic travel trip design, the travels services used, the money spent and the motivations for travel vary significantly by life stage.

Vietnam reasons for travelling 
Fearless – Vietnamese travellers aged 18 to 24 years
Vietnamese group of friends travel Being students and first jobbers, this group travels not only to “relax” but also to “explore the world” and record their journey with “beautiful pictures”. This is why they show high interest to newly discovered sites. Their favourite and common companions are their peers. With the spirit of “just backpack and go”, they prefer to manage their trips by themselves and hence are very familiar with review websites to prepare for their own journey. Having the least budget compared to other groups, they stay in homestays and eat street food more often. Rather than traditional tours, affordable services are more appealing to them. Making them “explorers” is a key hook.

Release – Vietnamese travellers aged 25 to 34 years

This group spend the most time (10 days) for travelling compared to the others. Besides relaxing, they go for a leisure trip to “have fun and excitement”. Destinations with entertainment or shopping sites are attractive to them. Having better finances than the younger age group, they fly more and choose to stay in resorts more. They are also more familiar with booking sites. Trips with colleagues and romantic trips are found most amongst travellers of this age group.

United – Vietnamese travellers aged 35 to 54 years
Vietnamese young family travel 

With the highest budget for travelling, this group have a tendency to travel overseas the most and also use tour services the most.  This is the target group for premium travel services. They travel mostly with their family. Therefore, tourism providers should design service that is comfortable for the whole family including older people and kids. Those 35-44 years old tend to seek for fun and excitement when travelling. They like shopping and also are familiar with booking platforms. Meanwhile, people 45-54 years old desire to relax and spend time with family. They rely more on their travel agency of choice.

Companionship – Vietnamese travellers aged 55 years plus

People 55 years old and above travel less often.  Those from age 65 show less interest in travelling. Their most common companion is their family members.

COVID-19 Impact on Vietnam travel habits
Cimigo Vietnam travel research conducted a survey update in June 2020, after the Corona 19 virus pandemic was constrained.  Vietnamese are reluctant to travel overseas but confident to plan for their next trip in Vietnam. By the end of 2020, the percentage of travellers is expected to be the same as in the prior year. Trips are expected to peak during July – August.

Travel promotions help to bring back Vietnam domestic travellers. Those planning to travel in 2020 even plan to spend more days (10 days) and higher budget 15,400,000 VND (approximately USD660) for travelling this year.

COVID-19 Impact on Vietnam travel 

People plan to travel with fewer people after the pandemic. Packaged tours are more appealing to them as they carry promotions which offer great value. Destinations in Vietnam which are closer to home and avoid air travel are prioritised.

Table of contents 
Travel to Vietnam, exploring the captivating beauty and rich cultural tapestry of this country, blessed by the warmth of its people. To enhance your travel experience and avoid cultural missteps, it is crucial to acquaint yourself with a few rules about dos and don’ts in Vietnam.
We share with you 20 valuable tips and recommendations on the dos and don’ts in Vietnam, ensuring you navigate with confidence and ease through Vietnam’s customs and etiquette.

10 Dos During Your Trip to Vietnam
1. Wear modest attire when visiting sacred places
Following local customs and dress codes – especially when visiting sacred places like temples, pagodas and other religious sites – demonstrates a deep respect for Vietnamese culture and traditions. This mindful practice not only helps avoid causing unintentional offense or discomfort to local communities and worshippers, but it also allows travelers to engage more meaningfully with the spiritual atmosphere of these places. By dressing modestly, removing shoes where required and behaving respectfully, visitors show appreciation for centuries-old beliefs and customs.

In doing so, you’re not just observing etiquette – you’re opening the door to a more authentic and enriching experience, one that fosters mutual respect and a deeper understanding of the cultural and spiritual significance of each site. Such gestures of cultural sensitivity often lead to warm interactions with locals and a stronger emotional connection to the places you visit.

2. Remove your shoes when entering a house or a temple
This gesture not only symbolizes reverence but also helps maintain cleanliness, especially in households where people use the floor for sitting and sleeping. Following this tradition helps avoid cultural misunderstandings and demonstrates appreciation and compliance with local standards. Shoes should also be removed when entering the various areas of temples and pagodas.

3. Adopt a respectful attitude towards locals and their customs
During a tour in Vietnam, international visitors often discover the friendly and welcoming nature of the Vietnamese people. By reciprocating with respect for their culture and traditions, travelers can foster positive and pleasant interactions with the locals.

4. Use small denominations of Vietnamese dong for transactions
This practice proves beneficial when dealing with various vendors, stores, and small street stalls. Having smaller denomination bills ensures a smooth shopping experience during your exploration of Vietnam.

This culinary adventure is a must, offering a unique exploration of the local culture at an affordable price.

5. Enjoy affordable street food in Vietnam
Enjoying affordable street food is one of the highlights of any Vietnam trip and it’s especially rewarding for those on Vietnam family tours. This culinary adventure offers much more than just delicious meals – it’s an immersive cultural experience that introduces your family to the heart of Vietnamese daily life. From savoring a warm bowl of pho on a busy Hanoi street to trying banh mi or freshly rolled spring rolls in Ho Chi Minh City, every dish reflects the bold flavors, fresh ingredients and regional diversity that make Vietnamese cuisine world-famous.

A Vietnam tour often includes guided food walks or visits to bustling local markets, where both kids and adults can sample authentic snacks, learn how dishes are prepared and interact with friendly local vendors. The affordability of street food also means families can try a wide variety of dishes without breaking the budget – turning each mealtime into a fun and memorable part of the journey. Whether in the north, central or southern regions, street food is an essential (and tasty) way to connect with Vietnamese culture as a family.

6. Visit local markets for an immersion into vibrant culture
Vietnam’s markets provide an opportunity to taste delicious street specialties, discover distinctive souvenirs, and interact with friendly locals in the lively market atmosphere.

7. Bargain when shopping at Vietnam’s markets
Skillful negotiation is an integral part of the shopping experience in Vietnam, allowing visitors to interact with local sellers while bargaining for various goods. The key to successful bargaining lies in maintaining a friendly and respectful attitude to secure the best deal possible for souvenirs and other items.

8. Expect bustling traffic, especially in major cities
During your Vietnam tours, especially in bustling cities like Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and Da Nang, it’s important to stay alert and aware of your surroundings. Traffic in Vietnam can be overwhelming at first, with a constant flow of motorbikes, cars and pedestrians sharing the same space. Always follow traffic rules and use crosswalks carefully. If you’re exploring on foot, be extra cautious at busy intersections and try to avoid walking during peak traffic hours – typically early morning and late afternoon.

To navigate the cities more smoothly, consider using ride-sharing apps like Grab, which are widely available and offer a convenient, affordable way to get around. Many travelers on their trip to Vietnam find that using these services not only saves time but also provides a more relaxed experience, especially in unfamiliar areas. Whether you’re visiting local attractions or heading to your next destination, a little caution and smart planning go a long way toward making your Vietnam journey safe and enjoyable.

9. Protect yourself from tropical sun with sunscreen and a hat
These simple measures are essential to shield yourself from sunburns and heat-strokes, ensuring a comfortable exploration of Vietnam’s diverse landscapes.

10. Learn a few basic phrases in Vietnamese to show respect for local culture
Even a simple “xin chào” (hello) or “cảm ơn” (thank you) in Vietnamese can significantly enhance your communication and foster positive connections with the Vietnamese people you encounter during your journey.

10 Don’ts During Your Trip to Vietnam
1. Avoid revealing clothing and inappropriate behavior in temples
Modesty is crucial, especially when visiting religious sites. Dress appropriately by covering your shoulders and knees as a sign of respect for cultural norms. Do not touch offerings on altars in temples and houses, as they are meant for the deceased.

2. Don’t raise your voice in public
Expressing emotions, especially anger, openly is considered inappropriate. Resolving issues calmly and privately is seen as more respectful to prevent misunderstandings and conflicts.

3. Show restraint in public displays of affection
Intimate physical contact, such as kissing or hugging, should be avoided in public spaces, particularly in conservative areas. Holding hands is generally acceptable, but follow the locals’ example.

4. Don’t disrespect the national flag and leaders
When traveling in Vietnam, it’s important to show respect for national symbols, including the Vietnamese flag, national emblems and images or references to political leaders. Any form of disrespect – intentional or not – towards these symbols or figures is considered a serious offense and can lead to legal consequences. This includes actions such as defacing currency, making inappropriate comments about the government or mocking political leaders, whether in person or online.

Foreign visitors are encouraged to be mindful of local customs and laws and to avoid sensitive political discussions in public settings. Demonstrating cultural awareness and respect not only ensures a trouble-free trip but also reflects positively on you as a guest in the country.

5. Avoid touching the head without permission
The head is considered the most sacred part of the body in Vietnamese culture, and unauthorized contact is seen as disrespectful.

6. Do not use your feet to point
Gestures with the feet are offensive as they are considered the lowest part of the body. Use hand gestures to convey messages respectfully.

7. Don’t take someone’s photos before seeking permission
Asking for permission before taking photographs, especially in situations where a small fee may be requested, is a courteous gesture respecting privacy and cultural sensitivities.

8. Avoid tap water; opt for bottled water
To prevent potential health risks, especially in rural areas, choose bottled water from reputable brands like “La Vie” or “Aquafina.”

9. Do not litter
Proper waste disposal is essential to contribute to environmental preservation, as Vietnam faces waste management challenges.

10. Avoid sensitive topics like war or politics
To prevent awkward situations, refrain from discussing emotionally charged topics such as war or politics during conversations with locals. Instead, focus on exploring Vietnam’s rich cultural heritage, natural beauty, and culinary delights.

By adhering to these guidelines on the dos and don’ts of Vietnam, travelers can foster positive and meaningful connections with the local community, ensuring a pleasant journey in Vietnam.

Have a nice trip!

Google launches Travel Insights to support Vietnam tourism industry

Nhat Minh
Dec 11, 2020 / 06:02 AM
The website is as part of Google’s initiatives to promote and support the recovery of local tourism industries.
Google launched on December 9 Travel Insights, a website to provide global data and insights into Vietnam’s tourism and travel industry with the aim to help better understand pent-up travel demand and leverage insights from these tools to plan for the road ahead.

Ms. Tram Nguyen, Country Manager of Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia at Google Asia Pacific, said: “We’ve heard from our partners, such as the Vietnam National Administration of Tourism, that data and insights are critical to helping them plan ahead, and we’ve created three new tools to help meet that need.” 

The website will provide three data and insights tools. Destination Insights - this tool will give a clear picture of the top sources of demand for a destination, and the destinations within countries that travelers are most interested in visiting - helping the industry map out a possible resumption of travel on specific routes and make choices about where to communicate with potential future travelers. 

Hotel Insights is designed to help hotels of all sizes, especially small and independent hotels, understand where demand for their property may be coming from and how to target their marketing as they plan their recovery. The Travel Analytics Center - available to Google’s commercial partners in the travel sector - will enable organizations to combine their own Google account data with broader Google demand data and insights to give a clearer picture of how to manage their operations and find opportunities to reach potential visitors.  

Over the last few weeks, several global tourism and travel organizations such as the UNWTO, ASEAN Secretariat, the Ministry of Tourism and Creative economy of Indonesia, Vietnam National  Administration of Tourism, Singapore Tourism Board, Taiwan Tourism Bureau, and others - have had early access to the Destination Insights tool. Many of these partners have already been using the tool to get insights into both inbound and outbound demand from their countries. 

The launch of Destination Insights is at perfect timing for Vietnam as Ho Chi Minh City is working on recovering measures for the tourism industry and restructuring destinations for the post-Covid-19 period, Mrs. Vo Thi Ngoc Thuy, Deputy Director for the Department of Tourism of Ho Chi Minh City said. “This tool is very useful as we can monitor domestic and international travel demand with real-time data. We wish to access these data as soon as possible and hope that this tool will be improved as time goes on so that we can make statistical comparisons between countries,” she added.

As part of the effort to support Vietnam’s tourism industry, Hue is a city that Google directs their attention towards with activities like generating a 3D model for the Mausoleum of Emperor Tu Duc on Google Art & Cultures and upload the model on Search. 

Mr. Nguyen Van Phuc, Deputy Director for Hue city’s Tourism Department, said that with the ability to provide data and insights on the tourism industry, the website will be a good support for destinations, businesses, and the authority to manage tourism at the current moment in which the city needs to be cautious to prevent Covid-19 while finding solutions to slowly recover the tourism industry, reconfiguring new travel products and services to meet the current demand from travelers. Hue and other provinces in Vietnam can push for a revival in local tourism.

The website will be a helpful and reliable resource to support managers and businesses in the tourism industry in creating business strategies to grow a sustainable travel industry, Mr. Ho An Phong, Vice Chairman of the Quang Binh People's Committee, said.

The Destination Insights Tool indicates that domestic demand in Vietnam is on a steady path to recovery back to 100% of 2019 levels, especially in the past two weeks. Coastal and nature areas are growing in popularity and Ha Giang has become the fastest growing destination growing at over 75% over the last two months - pointing towards more Vietnamese travelers looking to travel in places which are off the beaten track.
